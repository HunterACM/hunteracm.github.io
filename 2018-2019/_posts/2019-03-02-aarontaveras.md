Hey everyone, I'm Aaron. I'm a senior Hunter CS major who's love for tech is matched only by a love for community and people! Ever since I was given an old gateway (remember them?) PC in kindergarten, I've been hooked on computers and all-things software -- serving as the resident IT staff for my family while growing up. After discovering computer science and programming during my third year at Staten Island Technical HS, I hastily made the decision to spend the rest of my life doing so -- and while it has been far from easy I'm extremely glad I did! I currently work as a full-time dev and love the work that I do. Ask me about anything ranging from interview preparation, to motivation and imposter syndrome, to your favorite video game series. I'm here to serve, and I'm thrilled to work with Hunter students to foster an inclusive and dynamic CS community experience!
