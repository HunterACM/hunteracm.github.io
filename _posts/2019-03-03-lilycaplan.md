Hi! My name is Lily Caplan, I'm president of the ACM club. I'm passionate about bringing people together and fostering a community within the computer science department here at Hunter. I hope that you find the club to be a place where you can learn something new, work on projects, or just find like minded people. I would love to get to know everyone, so don't hesitate to reach out! You can find me over facebook, slack, or email.
