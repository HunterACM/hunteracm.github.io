Sue is a super-super-super senior majoring in computer science. She graduated from college in 2015 with a degree in American Studies and returned to school six months later to study CS. She didn’t take her first computer science class until the last semester of her first senior year. It was a CS + X style class that taught introduction to computer science and programming with liberal arts applications. She absolutely loved it! She learned that she could use computer science to explore the things she’s passionate about, like learning languages, listening to music, and drinking good coffee. She loves building apps that make doing these things easier and going to hackathons and workshops to learn the skills to do this well. Sue is grateful to be a part communities of people who help each other grow as developers. She believes that having a supportive environment where people can come together to share their experiences and knowledge makes studying computer science fun and meaningful.
