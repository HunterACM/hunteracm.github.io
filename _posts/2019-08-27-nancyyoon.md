Nancy is a soon-to-be senior who studies Computer Science as a second BA degree. Her first degree was earned in Screen Writing in South Korea. While she was working as a writer, she realized that she was not ready for writing any stories that could make people convinced / moved or touched because she didn't truly know about the life and people, so she decided to move to NYC, where all different human beings live. She was lucky to find a job as an accountant even though she didn't have any background and had a chance to work with talented software engineers and designers. By observing them, she learned that how to program would be a powerful tool that would express her own creative thoughts and make them real. That's why she is here at Hunter. She is very excited to meet all of you as one of the new ACM chapter officer.
