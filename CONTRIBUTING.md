# Making Contributions

Contributing is currently limited to board members. 
This will change after the site is launched. 
If you're updating your bios of fixing typos / grammatical errors, feel free to make your changes and commit directly to master. 
For anything else, please submit an issue first. 
The active development branch is [dev](https://github.com/hunteracm/hunteracm.github.io/tree/dev) and all contributions, other than those previously specified, will only be accepted here. 
Pull requests must be reviewed before merging.

This website is adapted from an existing theme. Check out [the original theme's repository](https://github.com/wowthemesnet/affiliates-jekyll-theme) to learn about how to download and serve the site.
