## Updating Board Member Bios

This section only applies to current Hunter ACM board members. 

Please update your bios and optionally include a photo of yourself. Your bio can be as long or as short as you want it to be, and can include images, gifs, emojis, etc. Tell us about yourself! (e.g. What are your interests? What is your position on the board? What do you bring to our community? What do you hope members get out of being part of Hunter ACM?) Have fun with it!

You're welcome to make your changes directly on the master branch when updating your bios. Please make contributions using your own GitHub accounts and not the Hunter ACM Board account. 

Save your bio in the  `_posts` directory as `<date>-<yourname>.md`. Copy the following snippet into that file and edit it to include your name, a link to your photo, and an introduction.
```

layout: post
title:  "<Your Name>"
author: board
categories: [ "Meet the Board" ]

Hello, world! My name is ...
```

If you would like to be listed as an author, add your information to `_config.yml`. Here is an example:
```
  suzenfylke:
    name: suzenfylke
    display_name: "Suzen Fylke"
    gravatar: 6f00367f46bd1774aa815c648fe089bb
    web: http://www.suzenfylke.com/
    description: "Sue is a senior majoring in CS. She makes language learning fun! With computers."
```
If you add yourself as an author in the configuration file, you may list yourself as an author on your bio page. Replace `board` with your author key, as in the following example:

```

layout: post
title:  "Suzen Fylke"

categories: [ "Meet the Board" ]
image: assets/images/suzenfylke.png

```
