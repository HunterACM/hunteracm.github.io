# Hunter ACM Website

This is an initial draft of the new Hunter ACM website. 

We will redirect hunter.acm.org here.

**Before we do that, we must:**

- [ ] Attribute any images we use.
- [ ] Consider replacing the jumbotron image. We're currently using stefan-stefancik-257625-unsplash, which came with the theme.
- [ ] Complete board member bios.
- [ ] Test ideal photo size and quality for the featured images in board member bios.
- [ ] Replace the stock images in board member bios.
- [ ] Make the authors.board description less clunky.
- [x] Publish the Facebook page.

**Contributing:**

Contributing is currently limited to board members. This will change after the site is launched. If you're updating your bios or fixing typos / grammatical errors, feel free to make your changes and commit directly to master. For anything else, please submit an issue first. The active development branch is [dev](https://github.com/hunteracm/hunteracm.github.io/tree/dev) and all contributions, other than those previously specified, will only be accepted here. Pull requests must be reviewed before merging.

This website is adapted from an existing theme. Check out [the original theme's repository](https://github.com/wowthemesnet/affiliates-jekyll-theme) to learn about how to download and serve the site.
