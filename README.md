# Welcome to Hunter ACM!

Hunter ACM is a community of Hunter College students interested in CS and tech. We design, code, build, and learn about topics not taught in our classes.

We are a student chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), which is recognized as the "world's largest educational and scientific computing society". The Purposes of the ACM are "advancing the art, science, engineering, and application of information technology; fostering the open interchange of information to serve both professionals and the public; and promoting the highest professional and ethical standards". We subscribe to these purposes.
This website is adapted from an existing theme.

We strive to make Hunter ACM a safe, welcoming, and inclusive community for all our members. [Read our Code of Conduct](https://www.hunteracm.org/codeofconduct).
